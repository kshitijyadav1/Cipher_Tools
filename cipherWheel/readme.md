	##Merits:
		1. It is simple
		2. Easy to understand
	##Demrits:
		Easily Decrypt
		Too simple
Cipher wheel 
To make converting plaintext to ciphertext using the ceaser cipher easier. It use a cipher wheel, also called a cipher disk.
The cipher wheel consists of two rings upper rings and inner rings.
Each ring is split up into 26 slots.
